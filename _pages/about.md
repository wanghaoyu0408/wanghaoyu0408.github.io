I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at SUNY Albany. Before that, I received my Ph.D. degree under the advisory of Prof. [Jing Gao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinggao/) in School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University. I got my B.Eng. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China under the advisory of Prof. [Defu Lian](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/liandefu), and got my MS degree from SUNY Buffalo. Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:hwang28@albany.edu) if you are interested in my research or want to collaborate.
